# Overview
“Nature of Code” is a book by Daniel Shiffman that explores the natural world and how to simulate it using code. This repository contains my implementations of the book’s examples using p5.js, along with some additional examples. In contrast to the book, I have used TypeScript instead of JavaScript. The examples are organized by chapter and can be run directly in the browser.

# Setup
To run the examples, install the dependencies and start the development server.
```
npm install # install dependencies
npm run dev # start the development server
```
